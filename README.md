# ventsim
ventsim is a stata module to estimate interventionl direct and indirect effects using simulation and general linear models for the mediator, outcome, and any exposure-induced confounders. Models for each of the exposure-induced confounders are estimated. Then, a model for the mediator conditional on treatment and baseline covariates (if specified) is estimated, followed by a model for the outcome conditional on treatment, the mediator, the baseline covariates, and the exposure-induced confounders. These models may be linear, logistic, or poisson regressions. These models are then used to simulate potential outcomes and construct estimates of the interventional direct and indirect effect, the overall effect, and the controlled direct effect.
