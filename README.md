# ventsim
ventsim is a stata module to estimate interventional direct and indirect effects using simulation and general linear models for the mediator, outcome, and any exposure-induced confounders. A model for the mediator conditional on treatment and baseline covariates (if specified) is estimated, as is a model for the outcome conditional on treatment, the mediator, the baseline covariates, and the exposure-induced confounders. In addition, a model for each exposure-induced confounder is estimated. Any of these models may be linear, logistic, or poisson regressions. These modules are then used to simulate potential outcomes and construct estimates of interventional direct and indirect effects.
